Aljazeera-RSS
=============

Wordpress plugin fetches the latest RSS news from Aljazeera.net. 
The plugin is very simple and it uses the <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie</a> RSS reader which is already integrated into wordpress.
The plugin has few options in the widget panel and the feed is cached for 10 minutes for better performance, custom CSS could be added to custom.css file in the plugin folder
The plugin is hosted in the wodpress plugin directory you check there for more info and screenshots:
