Aljazeera-RSS
=============

Wordpress plugin fetches the latest RSS news from Aljazeera.net. 
The plugin is very simple and it uses the <a href="http://simplepie.org/">SimplePie</a> RSS reader which is already integrated into wordpress.
The plugin has few options in the widget panel:
<ol>
<li>Show/Hide Aljazeera logo</li>
<li>Show/Hide Aljazeera link</li>
<li>Show/Hide description of news</li>
<li>Number of items to show</li>
<li>Change RSS link (Incase aljazeera changed their RSS url)</li>
</ol>
The feed is cached for 10min for better performance<br>
If you want to add your own css, create a css file, name it custom.css and put it in the plugin folder<br>
I will post the link to the wordpress plugins directory as soon as I register it with wordpress. 

Any suggestions/issues/forks are welcome
